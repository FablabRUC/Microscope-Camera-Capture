# Microscope Camera Capture
Quick python sketch for taking photos from the camera connected to our microscope connected to a Raspberry Pi.
If you wish to use [yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), set the path for yolov5 and your weights in the *config.py*-file.
After settings the config, you can send to yolov5 by pressing the _ML_-button.

## TODOs:
* [ ] Video recording
* [ ] Show number of blood cells returned from yolov5
* [ ] Show stats in lower corner
